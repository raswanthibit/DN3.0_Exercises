EXERCISE 1 : INVENTORY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

1. Understand the problem :
Explain why data structures and algorithms are essential in handling large inventories.
Ans: Data structures and algorithms are crucial because they can handle large dynamic data and inventories. 
They are responsible for quick access, modification, optimization and management of data. with the help of
data structures and algorithms, its easy for maintaining and retreival of data.
Discuss the types of data structures suitable for this problem.
Ans: ArrayList and HashMap 
ArrayList is useful for maintaining a dynamic list of products where frequent additions and deletions are 
not the primary operations. HashMap is Ideal for situations where quick access, insertion, and deletion 
are required. It allows constant time complexity (O(1)) for these operations on average.

2. Analysis: 
Analyze the time complexity of each operation(add,update,delete) in your chosen data structure.
Ans: The add operation involves putting a new key-value pair into the HashMap. On average, 
this operation has a time complexity of O(1).The update operation involves checking if the key 
exists and then updating the value associated with the key and this operation also has a time 
complexity of O(1). The delete operation involves removing a key-value pair from the HashMap 
and has a time complexity of O(1).

Discuss how you can optimize these operations.
Ans: checking whether the load factor of the HashMap is managed properly. 
A high load factor can lead to increased time complexity due to collisions, while 
a low load factor can lead to wasted memory. For large updation or deletions, 
consider batch operations to reduce the overhead of multiple individual operations.
